# thesis_warehouse_operations_optimization
This repository contains the code that was developed during the master thesis investigating the optimization of warehouse operations using machine learning. 

Use train_model.py as your starting point. Find the multiple "main" definitions in the bottom half, they'll demonstrate how to perform training and benchmark simulations.

IMPORTANT: before execution, please verify that the SaveExperimentResults() method in train_model.py uses your desired path for saving the plots and log.
